### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Computer Science Major, specifically Information Systems, at Berea College. Currently on my last year for my Undergrad as excited to get my degree and eventually find my future career.

I am currently studying Linux enviorment's and their usage of KVMs. Furthermore, I am looking into the WSL project currently proposed by Microsoft, which seems farily interesting and seems to be gaining speed! I hope to continue to working on some PowerShell scripts to utilize the USMT tool on existing enterprise networks since my Co-op at Shaw Industries.
